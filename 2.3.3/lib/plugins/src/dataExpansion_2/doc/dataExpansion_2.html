<p><strong>Adaptive Multipoint   Radius</strong></p>
<p>The simplest version of Data Expansion we know is Maya Multipoint
type particle. A simulation can be done with few numbers of particles
(seed particle) that have multi points (second particle), so they look
like many particles even though the second particles just follow seed
particle, so usually it has a side effect where second particles look
like groups.</p>

<br>
uniform multipoints radius side effect</p>

<p>I tried to fix this problem using an adaptive radius of multipoint.
My idea is to use the distance between the current particle and the
nearest neighbor particle as a radius of multipoint radius.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="dataExpansion_2_files/radiusIdea.jpg" width="640" height="485"><br>
  <strong>B</strong> is the nearest neighbor particle of <strong>A</strong>, and <strong>r</strong>is the radius of A's multipoints radius.</p>
<p align="center">
<iframe src="dataExpansion_2_files/adaptiveRadius_qt_icon.htm" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" width="400" align="top" frameborder="0" height="320" scrolling="no"></iframe>
<br>
adaptive multipoints radius test</p>

<p>To do this, I had to find the nearest neighbor particle of every
particle. This is a very expansive process because I have to compare
the distance of every particle and find the minimum value. If the
number of particle is 100,000, comparing has to be done 10,000,000,000
times (100,000 * 100,000).</p>
<p>I tried this method in Maya using particle expression and  <a href="http://www.hosok2.com/project/dataExpansion_2/findNearestID.txt" target="_blank">Mel script</a>
and found it is impossible because once I increased the number of
particle up to 10,000, I couldn’t see the result. Not only the process
is expensive but also using Mel script in particle expression makes it
much slow. (I was waiting about 10 minutes and gave up...)</p>
<p>So, I did some research and found if I can make a special  data structure, which is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kd-tree" target="_blank">kd-tree</a>,
nearest neighbor searching can be much faster. Also, Nearest Neighbor
Searching is a well-known computer science issue, so there are some
useful libraries.<br>
  <br>
Thread-safe Approximate  Nearest Neighbor: <a href="http://compgeom.com/%7Estann/html/" target="_blank">http://compgeom.com/~stann/html/</a></p>
<p>This solution is even faster then regular nearest neighbor searching
using kd-tree because this is Approximate Nearest Neighbor Searching.
According to their explanation, it could be 10~100 times faster then
the accurate nearest neighbor searching. I tested it with 100,000
particles and took less then 5 seconds. It gives me not just the
nearest neighbor but the list of neighbors, so I can easily go to the
second nearest neighbor and the others. I think I can use this solution
for slicing through camera direction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Improved  Dots.so – Procedural Primitive DSO</strong></p>
<p>I have written a very simple Procedural Primitive DSO for my <a href="http://www.hosok2.com/project/cloud/cloud.htm">cloud project</a> which just creates 10 points in given position. I have added  little more features.</p>
<p>The major change is the distribution of the points. The previous
version just used random position of x, y, z, so its over all shape was
like a cube.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="dataExpansion_2_files/randomCube.jpg" width="299" height="299"></p>
<p>However, I needed sphere-like shape. I have also used  in_sphere() random function for my <a href="http://www.hosok2.com/project/helper/helper.htm">Python Helper Program project</a>, At that time,  I used <a href="http://pal.ece.iisc.ernet.in/%7Edhani/frohne/rv11reference.htm" target="_blank">Ivan Frohne’s python Random Number module</a>, but for this project I had to  do it in C. I tried to find some C library and found some C++ library instead  of C.</p>
<p>So, I tried to make it myself. It’s not so simple to get uniformly
distributed random positions in and on a sphere. There are two methods
that I tried and didn’t want to use for on_sphere().</p>
<p><img src="dataExpansion_2_files/badOnSphere.jpg" width="640" height="362"></p>
<p><a href="http://www.hosok2.com/project/dataExpansion_2/methodA.txt" target="_blank">Method A</a> is made by random numbers based on x, y, z value  and normalize them, and we can still see the cube edges. <a href="http://www.hosok2.com/project/dataExpansion_2/methodB.txt" target="_blank">Method B</a> has a artifact where more particles are near both  poles.</p>
<p>I did some research and found better method here.<br>
    <br>

  </p>
<p align="center"><img src="dataExpansion_2_files/onSphere.jpg" width="320" height="240"><br>
  And this is the <a href="http://www.hosok2.com/project/dataExpansion_2/onSphereRandom.txt" target="_blank">onSphereRandom()</a> C code</p>
<p>For inSphereRandom() I used onSphereRandom() and converted it to
Spherical Coordination System. Spherical Coordination System is another
way to describe a position in 3D space which uses two angles and one
distance from origin.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="dataExpansion_2_files/SphericalCoordinates_1201.gif" width="301" height="291"><br>
Source : <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalCoordinates.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalCoordinates.html</a></p>
<p>First I converted the original x, y, z values to Spherical
Coordination System (r, t, p) and put some random value into r
(distance from origin) and then converted r, t, p to x, y, z again and
got another artifact where more points are near the center.</p>

Source : <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DiskPointPicking.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DiskPointPicking.html</a></p>
<p>It can be fixed simply using sqrt(random()) for r instead of  using just random().</p>
<p align="center"><img src="dataExpansion_2_files/inSphere.jpg" width="320" height="240"><br>
  This is the <a href="http://www.hosok2.com/project/dataExpansion_2/inSphereRandom.txt" target="_blank">inSphereRandom()</a> C code.</p>
<p>And the new version of <a href="http://www.hosok2.com/project/dataExpansion_2/dots.cpp.txt" target="_blank">dots procedural primitive DSO</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ri Filter Plug-in</strong></p>
<p>The next step is converting the seed particles to the DSO. I used Ri
Filter Plug-in to replace RiPoints procedure, which is particle in
Maya, to RiDynamicLoad procedure, which is DSO call, in render time.</p>
<p>Ri Filter is an official way to do this kind of filtering. The
reason Pixar provides this method is because many studios and
individuals used to do this rib filtering by their own solutions, which
the doc calls home-grown solutions. However, often time it was easy to
spend more time for filtering rib then actual rendering. Using RiFilter
eliminates the disk I/O time and also save the disk space, because
everything is done in render time. RMS also now provides GUI for
RiFilter.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="dataExpansion_2_files/renderGlobalRifilter.jpg" width="403" height="254"></p>
<p>However, the example C++ code in the Doc was not so simple to me. It
took pretty much time to understand how it works. As well as, the
example code does more then just “Hello World”.</p>
<p>This is the <a href="http://www.hosok2.com/project/dataExpansion_2/HelloWorldRiFilter.cpp.txt" target="_blank">“Hello World”</a> RiFilter that I made.  It simply replaces RiCone to RiSphere and parses some parameters.</p>
<p>There are two header files for RiFilter. One is RiFilter.h and the
other one is RiPlugin.h. RiPlugin.h provides the contact point to the
renderer and use RiFilter.h as a dispatch table. RiFilter.h has almost
all Ri procedure that ri.h has, so user can re-define Ri procedure
using RiFilter.h.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of Ri procedure forms. One  is RiXxxx() and the other one is RiXxxxV().</p>
<p>For example, to make </p>
<p>Surface “plastic” “Ks” [0.6] “Kd” [0.2]</p>
<p>We could use</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>RtFloat spec[1] = {0.6};<br>
    RtFloat diff[1] = {0.2};<br>
    RiSurface(“plastic”,”Ks”,spec,”Kd”,diff,RI_NULL);</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, since Ri procedure can have various number of parameters
including primitive variables, ri.h provides the other form of
RiSurface call.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>RtFloat spec[1] = {0.6};<br>
    RtFloat diff[1] = {0.2};<br>
    RtToken keys[] = {“Ks”,”Kd”};<br>
    RtPointer vals[2];<br>
    vals[0] = (RtPointer)spec;<br>
    vals[1] = (RtPointer)diff;<br>
    RiSurfaceV(“plastic”,2,keys,vals);</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This form can be more flexible when rib procedure has to get parameters  dynamically in runtime.</p>
<p>RiFilter.h’s procedure form is the second form, so for this project
I could parse additional custom primitive variables such as particle id
for random seed or the adaptive multipoint radius that I made in Maya.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Points “P” [0 0 0 1 1 1] “constantwidth” [0.1]<span class="style2"> “id” [0 1]  “multipointsRadius” [1 2]</span> # &lt;- green parts are the primitive variables that I want to export from Maya.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>RMS provides a way to parse a custom attribute to a rib. If
attribute name in Maya is rmanFxxx, xxx variable goes to the rib as a
Float. Of course, we can do it for vector or integer using
rmanVmyvector or rmanImyint.</p>
<p>One of the tricky parts was that I’m converting RiPoints to DSO call
that makes again RiPoints. RiFilter works to readArchive and all
procedurals, which means the RiPoints made by DSO is also filtered
again. This is a kind of infinite loop. I spent so much time to find
this problem and finally fixed it by comparing the number of parameters
of RiPoints call, so if the RiPoints is from the original rib, it
becomes RiReadDynamic, and if it is from DSO, it just makes points and
terminates the process.</p>

The seed particle - 300,000 points</p>
<p>I didn’t use the slice technique at this time because I still have
long way to go for final solution. First of all, I have to solve the
shadow problem where each slice has to cast and receive a shadow each
other. Also a single frame has to be able to produce various numbers of
images dynamically. </p>
