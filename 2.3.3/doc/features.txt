
Maya2Renderer Features:
- based on liquidMaya(r772). 
  Note for liquidMaya developers and users: 
  Because I don't kow how to use the following features of liquidMaya(r772), 
  these features are reserved but not tested in Maya2Renderer:
      - Fluid Panel
      - Rendering with Scripts 
- fix many bugs
- tested on winXP(x86)/Win7(x86) and Maya2012(x86)
- use Aqsis ribout module to output rib file.
- refactor the translation process of rib file to construct a framework to support other renderers.
- refactor the translation process of maya shader graph to construct a framework to support other renderers.
- global settings for each supported renderer
- export shave hair for each supported renderer
- batchRender for each supported renderer
- add call log for mel functions.
